# Image classifier with Tensorflow

ðŸ”§ What I Did:

Developed and trained a custom image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Deployed the model by building a RESTful API with FastAPI, making the model easily accessible.
Created a sleek, user-friendly React frontend to allow users to upload images and receive predictions in real-time.
Integrated the backend API with the React app, providing a seamless experience for image classification.
